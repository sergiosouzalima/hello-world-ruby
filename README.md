Ruby
-------------

This application requires:

- Ruby 2.5.0

Why Ruby?
---------
* For this solution I chose Ruby due to its clear, elegant & very effective syntax.
  Ruby is one of the most wanted modern languages to learn nowadays.
  In this case, of course I could have chosen other languages like Python or .Net,
  but Ruby is the language i like the most for the time being :-D .
